                    Hello there and welcome to my 45rpm record collection. 
                    I used to be a bit of a record collector, but about 4 years ago I went digital (which isn't quite the same as Dylan going electric, 
                    but it was a big change). 
                    I subsequently sold off most of my collection. 
                    Anyway, I was looking for an excuse to play around with some infographics using only CSS (plus a few backgound images) so I chose what's left of my 7" singles.
                <br>
                I have 198 records left, which are a mixture of Funk, Soul, RnB, Reggae, Jazz and Latin. I have displayed them using a variety of statistics which can be seen below.
                <br>
                For the record: This page has no semantic value, it's just a bit of fun, done purely for my own enjoyment (and hopefully yours). Enjoy your stay.
